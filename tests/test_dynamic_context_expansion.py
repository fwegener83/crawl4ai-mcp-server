"""
Test suite for dynamic context expansion functionality.

This module provides comprehensive tests for:
1. Score-based neighbor inclusion with 0.75 threshold
2. Dynamic context expansion algorithms for marginal relevance queries
3. Performance impact assessment and optimization
4. Integration with overlap-aware chunking system

Following the plan's test-first development approach for Phase 1.2.
