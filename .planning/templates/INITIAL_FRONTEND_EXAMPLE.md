   - URL input validation works (valid URL format)
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Form shows ready state for submission

4. **User selects target collection**
   - Collection dropdown shows available collections
   - User can select "Tech Articles" collection
   - Selection is properly tracked in state

5. **User clicks "Start Crawl" button**
   - Crawl request is sent to backend API
   - Loading spinner appears in CrawlResultsList
   - Button becomes disabled during crawling

6. **System processes the crawl**
   - API call is made with correct parameters
   - Progress feedback is shown to user
   - Error handling works for failed requests

7. **Results appear in CrawlResultsList**
   - Crawled content is displayed properly
   - Results include title, URL, and content preview
   - User can see success indicators

8. **User can view detailed results**
   - Clicking result opens DocumentViewerModal
   - Full content is displayed with proper formatting
   - Modal can be closed and navigation works

## User Journey 3: Deep Crawl with Advanced Options
**Goal**: User can perform complex crawling with multiple pages and settings

1. **User switches to Deep Crawl tab**
   - DeepCrawlForm component loads with advanced options

   - Complex form state is managed correctly

2. **User configures crawl parameters**
   - Domain URL: "https://example-blog.com"
   - Max pages: 10
   - Crawl depth: 2
   - Include external links: false

3. **User sets up filtering options**
   - URL patterns to include: "*/articles/*"
   - URL patterns to exclude: "*/admin/*"
   - Keywords for content filtering: "javascript, react"

4. **User initiates deep crawl**
   - Form validation passes for all complex inputs
   - Crawl starts with progress tracking
   - Real-time updates show crawl progress

5. **System processes multiple pages**
   - Progress indicator shows pages processed

   - Cancel option is available and functional

6. **Results are organized and displayed**
   - Multiple pages are shown in organized list
   - User can filter and sort results
   - Bulk save to collection is available

## User Journey 4: Semantic Search and Discovery
**Goal**: User can search through crawled content using semantic search

1. **User has collections with crawled content**
   - Multiple collections exist with varied content
   - Content is properly indexed for search

2. **User opens semantic search interface**
   - SemanticSearch component loads correctly
   - Search input is ready and responsive
   - Collection filter options are available

3. **User enters search query "AI development best practices"**
   - Search input accepts and validates query
   - Real-time search suggestions work (if implemented)
   - Search can be triggered by enter or button

4. **System performs semantic search**
   - API call is made with search parameters
   - Loading state is shown during search
   - Results are ranked by relevance

5. **Search results are displayed**
   - SearchResultsList shows relevant content
   - Results include relevance scores and highlights
   - Pagination works for large result sets

6. **User can interact with search results**
   - Clicking result opens detailed view
   - User can save interesting results to new collection
   - Search history is maintained (if implemented)

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
