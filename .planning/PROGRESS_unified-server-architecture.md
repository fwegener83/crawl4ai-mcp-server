## Plan Analysis Results
### Key Implementation Points Extracted:
1. **Service Interfaces Required**:
   - IWebCrawlingService (extractContent, deepCrawl, previewLinks)
   - ICollectionService (listCollections, createCollection, CRUD ops)
   - IVectorSyncService (syncCollection, searchVectors, getSyncStatus)

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**:
   - DeclarativeContainer with providers.Singleton for shared state
   - providers.Factory for request-scoped services
   - Configuration providers for environment variables

3. **Architecture Target**:
   - Single unified_server.py process
   - Dual protocol support (MCP stdio + HTTP REST)
   - Shared service layer with protocol adapters
   - Complete RAG system removal (4 MCP tools + 8 HTTP endpoints)

4. **Test Strategy**:
   - Service Layer: 85% coverage focused on business logic
   - Protocol Adapters: 70% coverage for thin wrappers
   - Integration: MCP/HTTP consistency validation
   - Performance: Response time baseline comparison

## Implementation Phases Overview
### Phase 1: Service Layer Foundation (Days 1-4) - CURRENT
1. Design service interfaces (IWebCrawlingService, ICollectionService, IVectorSyncService)
2. Extract business logic from current servers into shared services
3. Implement dependency injection container with singleton management
4. Create focused unit tests for service layer with 85% coverage
5. Validate service behavior isolation and testability

### Phase 2: Unified Server Implementation (Days 5-7)
1. Create unified_server.py with dual protocol support
2. Implement MCP protocol handler with thin tool adapters
3. Implement HTTP protocol handler with controller adapters
4. Integrate service container with both protocol handlers
5. Validate protocol consistency and shared state management

### Phase 3: RAG Components Removal & System Integration (Days 8-10)
1. Remove 4 MCP tools and 8 HTTP endpoints related to RAG functionality
2. Clean up frontend API methods and UI components for RAG
3. Update test suite to remove RAG-specific tests and consolidate coverage
4. Validate complete system integration with both protocols
5. Performance benchmarking and optimization

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation & Deployment Readiness (Days 11-12)
1. End-to-end testing across all user journeys and integration scenarios
2. Security validation and performance optimization verification
3. Migration documentation and deployment procedures
4. Final system validation and rollback preparation

## Notes
Starting unified server architecture transformation. The plan shows this is a complex (11/15) architecture change requiring careful service layer extraction and dependency injection implementation. Focus on creating clean service abstractions that can support both MCP and HTTP protocols while eliminating RAG redundancy.

Critical success factors:
1. Service layer must be protocol-agnostic
2. Dependency injection must ensure proper singleton behavior
3. All existing functionality must be preserved
4. Performance must not regress
5. Test coverage must reach 85% for service layer
