- **Memory Usage**: Maximum 25% increase during processing ‚úÖ VALIDATED
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain current limits for frontend components (target)

## Notes
Backend implementation for enhanced RAG chunking complete. Critical UI architecture issue discovered requiring refactoring.

**Key success factors achieved:**
1. ‚úÖ Strict test-first development approach maintained
2. ‚úÖ Incremental validation completed for backend phases
3. ‚úÖ Performance monitoring validated - all budgets met
4. ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained with existing RAG infrastructure

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- Search functionality incorrectly integrated into File Collections area
- Violates separation of concerns principle
- File Collections should focus on content management + sync only
- RAG Query should handle all search + AI functionality

**Next Actions Required:**
1. Remove all search components from File Collections area
2. Enhance RAG Query page with advanced search features
3. Maintain sync management and collection statistics in File Collections
4. Update tests to reflect corrected architecture
