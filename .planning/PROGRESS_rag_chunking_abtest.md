## Architecture Decisions
- ADR-001: Overlap Implementation Strategy (Proposed)
- ADR-002: Context Expansion Approach (Proposed)  
- ADR-003: A/B Testing Framework Design (Proposed)

## Performance Budgets
- **Storage Increase**: Maximum 40% from overlapped chunks
- **Query Latency**: Maximum 25% additional overhead (50ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Maximum 25% increase during processing
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain current limits for frontend components

## Notes
Starting execution of comprehensive full-stack plan for enhanced RAG chunking with A/B testing.
Key success factors:
1. Strict test-first development approach
2. Incremental validation at each phase
3. Performance monitoring throughout development
4. Statistical rigor in A/B testing framework
5. Backward compatibility with existing RAG infrastructure
