## Failed Tasks
None yet.

## Quality Validation Status
### Backend Quality Checks
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage: Meets 90% target requirements
- [ ] Performance: API response times maintained
- [ ] Security: Authentication and authorization unchanged

### Integration Quality Checks
- [ ] API contracts: All 17 endpoint pairs maintain compatibility
- [ ] Data flow: Cross-protocol data flow tested
- [ ] Error handling: Cross-protocol error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance: Full-stack performance maintained

## Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Collection Management (HIGH PRIORITY - 2-3 days)
Target: Refactor 9 endpoint pairs with most business logic duplication
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create `application_layer/collection_management.py` use-case functions
- [ ] Task 1.2: Write comprehensive tests for collection use-cases (TDD approach)  
- [ ] Task 1.3: Refactor MCP collection tools to use shared use-cases
- [ ] Task 1.4: Refactor REST collection endpoints to use shared use-cases
- [ ] Task 1.5: Validate all existing collection tests pass unchanged

### Phase 2: File Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 1-2 days)
Target: Refactor 5 endpoint pairs with URL encoding complexity
- [ ] Task 2.1: Create `application_layer/file_management.py` use-case functions
- [ ] Task 2.2: Write tests for file operation use-cases including URL encoding scenarios
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add missing MCP tools for complete protocol parity (PUT, DELETE, LIST files)
- [ ] Task 2.4: Refactor existing file endpoints to use shared use-cases
- [ ] Task 2.5: Validate file operation test suite passes

### Phase 3: Web Crawling (LOW PRIORITY - 0.5-1 day)
Target: Refactor 3 endpoint pairs for consistency
- [ ] Task 3.1: Create `application_layer/web_crawling.py` use-case functions
- [ ] Task 3.2: Write tests for crawling use-cases (minimal duplication)
- [ ] Task 3.3: Refactor web crawling endpoints to use shared use-cases
- [ ] Task 3.4: Ensure consistent error handling and response formats

### Phase 4: Protocol Completeness (CRITICAL - 0.5 days)
Target: Achieve 100% protocol parity
- [ ] Task 4.1: Add missing MCP tool: `crawl_single_page_to_collection()`
- [ ] Task 4.2: Create `application_layer/crawl_integration.py` use-case function
- [ ] Task 4.3: Ensure 100% protocol parity between API and MCP
- [ ] Task 4.4: Validate complete feature coverage across both protocols

## Success Criteria Tracking
- [ ] All 17 endpoint pairs refactored to use shared use-case functions
- [ ] 100% API backward compatibility maintained (all existing tests pass)
- [ ] Complete MCP protocol parity achieved (every API endpoint has MCP equivalent)
- [ ] Use-case functions achieve 90% test coverage with comprehensive validation
- [ ] Consistent error handling and response formats across both protocols
- [ ] No performance degradation in response times for any endpoint
- [ ] Codebase maintainability improved through centralized business logic

## Notes
Starting execution of comprehensive refactoring plan. Using proven pattern from existing vector search refactoring (`application_layer/vector_search.py`) as template. Focus on test-first development to ensure 100% backward compatibility.
