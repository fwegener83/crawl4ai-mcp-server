## Phase 1: Deep Exploration Results

### HYPERTHINK Analysis Summary
Comprehensive analysis revealed that the enhanced RAG chunking strategy requires sophisticated backend algorithm changes with ChromaDB integration, moderate frontend dashboard components, and complex integration coordination. The feature builds upon existing sophisticated infrastructure including EnhancedContentProcessor, intelligent sync management, and comprehensive chunking configuration system. Key technical challenges include implementing 20-30% chunk overlap without performance degradation, developing dynamic context expansion based on relevance scores, and creating robust A/B testing framework with statistical significance validation.

### Context Research Findings

#### LangChain Text Splitting Best Practices
Research confirmed that RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with chunk_overlap parameter is the industry standard approach:
- **Chunk Overlap Implementation**: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)` provides 20% overlap
- **Markdown-Aware Splitting**: Two-stage approach using `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` → `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
- **Performance Optimization**: Hierarchical separators (`["\n\n", "\n", ". ", ", ", " ", ""]`) for semantic preservation
- **Dynamic Context**: Post-retrieval context expansion based on similarity scores

#### ChromaDB Vector Operations
- **Collection Management**: Efficient metadata storage and filtering for chunk relationships
- **Query Performance**: `query(query_texts=[], n_results=10, include=["distances", "metadatas"])` for relevance-based retrieval
- **Metadata Relationships**: `where` filters enable chunk parent/neighbor relationship queries
- **Batch Operations**: `add()` with batch processing for large overlapped datasets

#### Existing Codebase Architecture Analysis
**Sophisticated Foundation Discovered:**
- `ChunkingConfig`: Comprehensive configuration with A/B testing support already present
- `MarkdownContentProcessor`: Two-stage intelligent splitting (header-aware → size-controlled)
- `EnhancedContentProcessor`: Multi-strategy processor with A/B testing framework foundation
- `IntelligentSyncManager`: Database-backed sync status with incremental processing
- `VectorStore`: ChromaDB wrapper with persistent storage and collection management

**Key Integration Points Identified:**
- Configuration system supports overlap parameters and A/B testing flags
- Content processors use configurable chunk_size and chunk_overlap parameters
- Vector sync system tracks chunk metadata and relationships
- Database adapter provides collection-level operations

### Architecture Decision Recording

**ADR-001: Overlap Implementation Strategy**
- **Decision**: Extend existing `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with enhanced overlap calculation rather than replacing
- **Rationale**: Maintains compatibility with existing chunking infrastructure while adding new capabilities
- **Alternatives**: Complete rewrite vs. wrapper approach vs. extension approach (chosen)

**ADR-002: Context Expansion Approach**
- **Decision**: Post-retrieval context expansion based on similarity score thresholds
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility without impacting storage requirements significantly
- **Alternatives**: Pre-indexing expanded chunks vs. real-time expansion (chosen) vs. hybrid approach

**ADR-003: A/B Testing Framework Design**
- **Decision**: Collection-level strategy assignment with user session consistency
- **Rationale**: Enables fair comparison while maintaining user experience consistency
- **Alternatives**: Query-level randomization vs. collection-level (chosen) vs. user-level assignment

## Implementation Roadmap

### Development Sequence (Test-First Mandatory)
1. **Test Infrastructure Enhancement**: Extend existing test frameworks for overlap and A/B testing scenarios
2. **Test-Driven Overlap Implementation**: Write comprehensive tests → implement overlap algorithms → verify performance
3. **Test-Driven Context Expansion**: Write neighbor retrieval tests → implement dynamic expansion → verify accuracy
4. **Test-Driven A/B Framework**: Write statistical comparison tests → implement framework → verify significance calculations  
5. **Test-Driven Frontend Development**: Write component tests → implement dashboard → verify user workflows
6. **Test-Driven Integration**: Write end-to-end tests → complete integration → verify production readiness

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: Each phase requires complete testing before moving to next phase. Never implement functionality without comprehensive test coverage first.

### Risk Mitigation
**Technical Risks:**
- **Performance Degradation**: Implement performance budgets (storage: +40% max, query time: +25% max) with automatic monitoring
- **Statistical Validity**: Use established libraries (scipy.stats) for significance testing with proper confidence intervals
- **ChromaDB Scalability**: Implement batch processing and connection pooling for large collections
- **Integration Complexity**: Comprehensive API contract testing and staged rollout approach

**Operational Risks:**
- **Data Migration**: Backward-compatible metadata schema changes with rollback procedures
- **Storage Growth**: Smart deduplication strategies and monitoring alerts for storage usage
- **User Experience**: Feature flags for gradual rollout and quick rollback capability
