## Quality Validation Status
### Backend Quality Checks
- [x] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [x] Test coverage: Meets baseline requirements (85%)
- [x] Performance: API response times within acceptable range
- [x] Security: Authentication and authorization validated

### Frontend Quality Checks  
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage: Meets target requirements (90%)
- [ ] Build: Production build succeeds
- [ ] Bundle size: Within acceptable limits (â‰¤15% increase)
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG compliance validated

### Integration Quality Checks
- [ ] API contracts: All contracts validated and tested
- [ ] Data flow: Cross-stack data flow tested
- [ ] Authentication: End-to-end auth flows work
- [ ] Error handling: Cross-stack error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance: Full-stack performance meets requirements

## User Journey Validation
- [ ] Journey 1: Collection Management - Complete stack E2E test passes
- [ ] Journey 2: Web Crawling - Complete stack E2E test passes
- [ ] Journey 3: File Collection Management - Complete stack E2E test passes
- [ ] Error Scenarios: Comprehensive error handling tested across stack
- [ ] Performance: All journeys meet performance requirements
- [ ] Accessibility: All journeys accessible and compliant

## Notes
Starting MUI-based frontend redesign with Atomic Design principles. Plan calls for 7-week implementation across 6 phases. Backend remains stable throughout migration. Focus on component-by-component migration with comprehensive testing at each stage.
