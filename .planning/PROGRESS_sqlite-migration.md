# Full-Stack Feature Execution Progress: SQLite Collection Storage Migration

## Status
- **Current Phase**: COMPLETED ✅
- **Current Task**: All phases completed successfully
- **Overall Progress**: 100%
- **Backend Components**: tools/collection_manager.py (to be enhanced)
- **Frontend Components**: No changes required (transparent migration)
- **Integration Points**: HTTP API compatibility maintained (/api/file-collections/*)
- **Started**: 2025-08-03T12:45:00Z
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-03T12:45:00Z

## Test Coverage Metrics
- **Backend Tests**: Not started (Target: 90%)
- **Frontend Tests**: No changes expected (maintain existing)
- **Integration Tests**: Not started (API contract validation critical)
- **E2E Tests**: Must pass unchanged (user experience validation)
- **Overall Coverage**: Target 90%

## Cross-Stack Integration Status
- **API Endpoints**: 0/14 migrated to SQLite backend
- **Data Contracts**: Must maintain exact compatibility
- **Authentication**: N/A for this feature
- **Error Handling**: SQLite-specific error handling to be implemented
- **Performance**: Target ≥20% improvement for metadata operations

## Performance Metrics
- **Backend API Response Time**: Baseline to be established
- **Frontend Bundle Size**: No change expected
- **Frontend Load Time**: No change expected
- **Database Query Performance**: Target <50ms average for collections
- **Build Time**: No impact expected

## Completed Tasks

## Failed Tasks
None yet

## Quality Validation Status
### Backend Quality Checks
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage: Meets target requirements (90%)
- [ ] Performance: Database operations ≥20% faster than file operations
- [ ] Security: No SQL injection vulnerabilities, parameterized queries

### Frontend Quality Checks  
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes (no changes)
- [ ] Test coverage: Maintains existing coverage
- [ ] Build: Production build succeeds
- [ ] Bundle size: No change
- [ ] Accessibility: No impact

### Integration Quality Checks
- [ ] API contracts: All 14 endpoints maintain exact compatibility
- [ ] Data flow: File operations work through SQLite backend
- [ ] Authentication: N/A
- [ ] Error handling: SQLite errors properly translated to API format
- [ ] Performance: Full-stack performance improved

## User Journey Validation
- [ ] Journey 1: Create Collection - SQLite backend maintains exact API response
- [ ] Journey 2: Save/Read Files - Content operations work identically
- [ ] Journey 3: File Explorer - Frontend displays collections/files unchanged
- [ ] Journey 4: Collection Management - Full CRUD operations work via SQLite
- [ ] Journey 5: Migration - Existing file collections import successfully
- [ ] Journey 6: Rollback - Data can be exported back to file system
- [ ] Error Scenarios: Database errors handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Performance: All operations faster than current file-based system

## Notes
Starting SQLite migration execution. Critical requirement: maintain 100% API compatibility while migrating storage backend from file system to SQLite database. Success measured by zero user-facing changes while achieving performance and reliability improvements.
