- [x] Phase 1, Task 1.2 - Create core MCP protocol regression test (Commit: a744b01)
- [x] Phase 2, Task 2.3 - Component testing regression (integrated into test_server.py) (Commit: 5c176e1)
- [x] Phase 3, Task 3.1 - Update README.md test commands (Commit: 5c176e1)
- [x] Phase 3, Task 3.3 - Clean up dangerous temporary files (Commit: 5c176e1)
- [x] Validation Fix - Correct parameter validation assumptions (Commit: a07b7c3)

## Failed Tasks
(None yet)

## Test Coverage History
- Initial: Baseline to be established

## Notes
Starting execution of testing knowledge consolidation plan. Critical discovery: Missing `notifications/initialized` step in MCP protocol sequence causes test failures.

## LEAN APPROACH MODIFICATIONS
Instead of creating 4 new test files as originally planned, implemented a more lean approach:
- **Created**: 1 new file (`test_mcp_protocol_regression.py`) for critical MCP protocol testing
- **Enhanced**: Existing `test_server.py` with component regression tests
- **Integrated**: Valuable patterns into existing structure instead of separate files
- **Result**: Maximum value preservation with minimal file proliferation

## CRITICAL DISCOVERIES
1. **MCP Protocol**: `notifications/initialized` step is absolutely required for Claude Desktop integration
2. **Server Behavior**: Our server is more lenient than expected (accepts tools/list without params)
3. **Test Coverage**: Existing tests only used FastMCP Client, bypassing full protocol sequence
4. **Knowledge Validation**: Temporary files contained both valuable insights AND false assumptions

## SUCCESS METRICS ACHIEVED
- ✅ Critical failure modes now covered by automated tests
- ✅ Test execution time maintained (<10 seconds for critical regression tests)
- ✅ Valuable debugging knowledge preserved and formalized
- ✅ False/dangerous knowledge removed from codebase
- ✅ Lean approach: 1 new file + enhanced existing file vs 4 new files originally planned
