## Planned Tasks

### Phase 1A: Foundation & Backend Integration (Week 1) - CRITICAL
**Priority: Backend dependency resolution**

#### Task 1: Backend HTTP API Layer Implementation
- [ ] Create HTTP endpoints wrapping existing MCP tools
- [ ] Implement request/response serialization
- [ ] Add authentication and validation middleware
- [ ] **Acceptance**: All 8 endpoints functional with proper error handling

#### Task 2: Frontend Service Layer Extension
- [ ] Extend APIService with collection file operations
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] **Acceptance**: Service layer tests pass, error handling comprehensive

#### Task 3: Basic Component Architecture Setup
- [ ] Create component file structure
- [ ] Implement basic routing between collections
- [ ] Set up state management foundation (Context + Reducer)
- [ ] **Acceptance**: Navigation works, state management functional

### Phase 1B: Core File Management (Week 2)
#### Task 4: CollectionSidebar Implementation
#### Task 5: FileExplorer with Folder Support
#### Task 6: MarkdownEditor Integration

### Phase 1C: Advanced File Operations (Week 3)
#### Task 7: File CRUD Operations
#### Task 8: Simple Page Crawl Integration
#### Task 9: Modal System & User Workflows

### Phase 1D: Quality Assurance & Polish (Week 4)
#### Task 10: Accessibility Implementation
#### Task 11: Performance Optimization
#### Task 12: Comprehensive Testing

## Completed Tasks
None yet.

## Failed Tasks
None yet.

## Full-Stack Quality Checks
- [ ] TypeScript: All files compile without errors
- [ ] ESLint: No warnings or errors
- [ ] Tests: All test suites pass (unit/integration/e2e)
- [ ] Build: Production build succeeds
- [ ] Bundle Size: Within acceptable limits
- [ ] Backend APIs: All integrated endpoints working
- [ ] Data Contracts: Frontend/backend data models aligned
- [ ] Authentication: Auth flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Error Handling: API errors properly handled in UI
- [ ] Accessibility: Basic a11y requirements met

## User Journey Validation
- [ ] Journey 1: Collection Lifecycle Management - E2E test passes with real backend data
- [ ] Journey 2: Simple Page Crawling to Collection - E2E test passes with real backend data
- [ ] Journey 3: File Editor Integration - E2E test passes with real backend data
- [ ] Journey 4: Manual File Management - E2E test passes with real backend data
- [ ] Error Scenarios: API failures properly handled in UI
- [ ] Authentication: Login/logout flows working
- [ ] Performance: User journeys meet performance benchmarks

## Backend Integration Notes
- **Critical Dependency**: The frontend development is blocked until backend HTTP API layer is implemented
- **MCP Tools Available**: Existing CollectionFileManager provides the core functionality, needs HTTP wrapper
- **Security Considerations**: Path validation and sanitization already implemented in CollectionFileManager
- **Data Model**: Collection and FileMetadata models need to be exposed via HTTP APIs

## Implementation Strategy
Following the comprehensive plan:
1. **Backend-First Approach**: Implement HTTP API layer before frontend components
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside implementation
3. **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing MarkdownEditor and modal components
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add advanced features

## Risk Mitigation Status
- **Backend API Dependency**: ⚠️ Critical - Must be resolved first
- **MarkdownEditor Integration**: Not started
- **State Management Complexity**: Not started  
- **Performance with Large Collections**: Not started
