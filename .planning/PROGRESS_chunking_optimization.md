## Problem Definition
**Issue**: German queries against English documentation return poor similarity scores (<0.1 threshold needed) despite excellent notebook performance (0.919 cross-language similarity)
**Expected Model**: distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1 (512D)
**Suspected Issue**: System still using old all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384D) despite .env configuration

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Planning Phase - Comprehensive plan created and approved
- [x] Phase 1, Task 1 - Root Cause Investigation (✅ Environment loading issue found)
- [x] Phase 1, Task 2 - Model Loading Fix (✅ Multilingual model now loads correctly, Commit: 246c5fe)
- [ ] Phase 2, Task 1 - Force Resync API (In Progress)

## Failed Tasks
None yet

## Quality Validation Status
### Backend Quality Checks
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage: Meets target requirements
- [ ] Performance: API response times within benchmarks
- [ ] Security: Authentication and authorization validated

### Frontend Quality Checks  
- [ ] Code quality: All linting and type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage: Meets target requirements
- [ ] Build: Production build succeeds
- [ ] Bundle size: Within acceptable limits
- [ ] Accessibility: WCAG compliance validated

### Integration Quality Checks
- [ ] API contracts: All contracts validated and tested
- [ ] Data flow: Cross-stack data flow tested
- [ ] Authentication: End-to-end auth flows work
- [ ] Error handling: Cross-stack error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance: Full-stack performance meets requirements

## User Journey Validation
- [ ] Journey 1: German query with good results - Cross-language search quality >0.5
- [ ] Journey 2: Model info visibility - User can see active model configuration
- [ ] Journey 3: Force resync workflow - User can delete all vectors and resync
- [ ] Journey 4: Collection cleanup - Collection deletion removes files and vectors

## Notes
Starting with root cause investigation of model loading. Priority is to verify which model is actually being loaded and why the configured model might not be used.
