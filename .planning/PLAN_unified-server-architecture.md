## Phase 1: Deep Exploration Results

### HYPERTHINK Analysis Summary

The unified server architecture transformation addresses a fundamental anti-pattern in the current dual-server setup. The analysis reveals that the core issue isn't just code duplication, but architectural fragmentation causing shared state violations, inconsistent APIs, and maintenance overhead.

**Key Architectural Insights:**
- **Service Layer Abstraction**: The proposed IWebCrawlingService, ICollectionService, and IVectorSyncService interfaces follow clean architecture principles, enabling protocol-agnostic business logic
- **Protocol Adapter Pattern**: Thin MCP tools and HTTP controllers acting as adapters to shared services ensures consistent functionality while preserving protocol-specific conventions
- **RAG Removal Strategy**: Eliminating redundant RAG collections isn't just cleanup—it's architectural simplification that creates a single source of truth for content management
- **Dependency Injection Benefits**: Proper DI container enables singleton guarantees, service lifecycle management, and better testability
- **Shared State Resolution**: Single VectorStore and CollectionManager instances eliminate the dual ChromaDB connection problem

### Context Research Findings

#### Full-Stack Architecture Patterns

**FastAPI Dependency Injection Patterns:**
- Declarative container approach using `providers.Singleton` and `providers.Factory`
- `@inject` decorator for automatic dependency resolution
- Configuration providers for environment variable management  
- Hierarchical dependency graphs with sub-dependencies
- Resource management for database connections and external services

**Service Layer Implementation Insights:**
- Domain-driven project structure with separate modules for auth, services, etc.
- Dependency injection at constructor level for services
- Factory and singleton patterns for different service lifecycles
- Configuration-based service selection (CSV vs SQLite finders)
- Abstract interfaces with concrete implementations

#### Backend Implementation Insights

**FastAPI Service Architecture:**
- Use `containers.DeclarativeContainer` for centralized dependency management
- Implement `providers.Singleton` for shared state (VectorStore, CollectionManager)
- Use `providers.Factory` for request-scoped services
- Environment-based configuration with `providers.Configuration`
- Protocol handlers as thin controllers delegating to services

**Dependency Injection Container Pattern:**
```python
class Container(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    config = providers.Configuration()
    
    # Shared singletons for state consistency
    vector_store = providers.Singleton(VectorStore, config=config.vector)
    collection_manager = providers.Singleton(CollectionManager, config=config.collections)
    
    # Service layer
    web_crawling_service = providers.Factory(WebCrawlingService, config=config.crawling)
    collection_service = providers.Factory(CollectionService, manager=collection_manager)
    vector_sync_service = providers.Factory(VectorSyncService, 
                                           vector_store=vector_store,
                                           collection_service=collection_service)
```

#### Frontend Implementation Insights  

**API Integration Patterns:**
- Axios interceptors for consistent error handling
- TypeScript interfaces for API contracts
- Centralized API service with method organization
- Request/response DTO validation
- Environment-based base URL configuration

**Component Architecture:**
- Domain-based component organization (collection/, forms/, ui/)
- Context providers for state management
- Hook-based API integration with `useApi`
- Error boundaries for fault tolerance
- Toast notifications for user feedback

#### Integration Patterns

**Protocol Adapter Implementation:**
```python
# MCP Tool Adapter (thin layer)
@mcp.tool()
async def list_file_collections():
    return await container.collection_service().list_collections()

# HTTP Controller Adapter (thin layer)
@app.get("/api/file-collections")
async def list_collections():
    result = await container.collection_service().list_collections()
    return {"success": True, "data": result}
```

**Shared State Management:**
- Single container instance per unified server process
- Singleton providers for stateful services
- Resource providers for connection management
- Configuration providers for environment variables

#### Testing Strategies Researched

**Service Layer Testing:**
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Mock external dependencies (crawl4ai, chromadb)
- Pytest markers for selective test execution
- Coverage targets of 95% for complex architectures

**Integration Testing:**
- Single process testing enables better integration validation
- Container override patterns for dependency mocking
- End-to-end testing across both protocols
- Performance benchmarking for response times

#### Performance & Security Insights

**Optimization Techniques:**
- Resource pooling for database connections
- Lazy initialization of expensive services
- Configuration caching with `@lru_cache`
- Background task processing with FastAPI

**Security Requirements:**
- Input validation at service layer
- Path traversal prevention in collection names
- File extension whitelisting for uploads
