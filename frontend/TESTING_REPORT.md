## Key Functionality Verified

### üéØ **Core Features Working**

1. **Collection Management**
   - Create new collections via modal
   - Display collection metadata (file count, folders, dates, sizes)
   - Collection selection and highlighting
   - Delete collections with confirmation

2. **File Management**
   - File tree display with proper hierarchy
   - Folder expansion/collapse functionality
   - File search and filtering
   - File selection and highlighting
   - File operations (open, delete)

3. **User Interface**
   - Responsive sidebar layout
   - Modal system for user actions
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Proper accessibility attributes
   - Dark mode support

4. **State Management**
   - Centralized state with React Context
   - Proper state updates via reducers
   - Error state management
   - Loading state coordination

## Issues Identified & Recommendations

### üîß **Minor Issues Found**

1. **API Integration**
   - File loading from collections appears to have placeholder logic
   - Some file operations may not be fully connected to backend

2. **Test Environment**
   - A few unit tests have DOM structure expectations that don't match exactly
   - Some E2E tests timeout on slower operations

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds might be aggressive for some use cases
   - Large file trees might need virtualization

### üìã **Recommendations for Improvement**

#### **Immediate (High Priority)**
1. **Complete API Integration**
   - Implement actual file loading from collections
   - Add proper error handling for network failures
   - Test with real backend data

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Add network connectivity checks
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add user feedback for offline states

#### **Short Term (Medium Priority)**
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large file lists
   - Add debouncing to search functionality
   - Optimize re-renders in file tree

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
   - Implement drag-and-drop for file organization
   - Add file preview functionality

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add more comprehensive E2E test coverage
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Add performance benchmarking tests

#### **Long Term (Lower Priority)**
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement file versioning
   - Add collaborative editing features
   - Integrate with external storage providers

2. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Add screen reader testing
