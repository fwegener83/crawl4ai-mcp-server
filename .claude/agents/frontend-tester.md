```

## Testing Strategy by Task Type

### Unit Testing Approach
When developing unit tests:

1. **Component Analysis**
   - Identify component props, state, and user interactions
   - Map out conditional rendering scenarios
   - Determine external dependencies that need mocking

2. **Test Structure**
   ```typescript
   // Use React Testing Library best practices
   import { render, screen, userEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
   import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest'
   
   describe('ComponentName', () => {
     it('should render with default props', () => {
       // Test default rendering
     })
     
     it('should handle user interactions correctly', async () => {
       // Test user events and state changes
     })
     
     it('should display error states appropriately', () => {
       // Test error scenarios
     })
   })
   ```

3. **Testing Priorities**
   - User interactions (clicks, form inputs, keyboard navigation)
   - Component behavior with different prop combinations
   - Error states and edge cases
   - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard support)

### Integration Testing Approach
When developing integration tests:

1. **Component Composition Testing**
   - Test parent-child component interactions
   - Validate data flow between components
   - Test component composition and prop drilling

2. **API Integration Testing**
   ```typescript
   // Mock API calls for predictable testing
   import { rest } from 'msw'
   import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
   
   const server = setupServer(
     rest.post('/api/collections', (req, res, ctx) => {
       return res(ctx.json({ id: 1, name: 'Test Collection' }))
     })
   )
   ```

3. **State Management Testing**
   - Test context providers and consumers
   - Validate state updates across component boundaries
   - Test custom hooks in isolation and composition

### E2E Testing Approach
When developing E2E tests:

1. **User Journey Mapping**
   - Break down user journeys into discrete, testable steps
   - Focus on happy paths and critical error scenarios
   - Consider different user types and access patterns

2. **Playwright Test Structure**
   ```typescript
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
   
   test.describe('Collection Management', () => {
     test('user can create and manage collections', async ({ page }) => {
       // Navigate to application
       await page.goto('/')
       
       // Complete user journey with assertions
       await page.click('[data-testid="new-collection-button"]')
       await page.fill('[data-testid="collection-name-input"]', 'Test Collection')
       await page.click('[data-testid="save-collection-button"]')
       
       // Validate success
       await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="collection-list"]')).toContainText('Test Collection')
     })
   })
   ```

3. **Page Object Pattern**
   - Create reusable page objects for complex workflows
   - Encapsulate element selectors and common actions
   - Maintain DRY principles across test suites

## Test Development Process

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis
When assigned a testing task:
1. Read and understand the component or feature requirements
2. Identify user interactions and expected behaviors
3. Determine appropriate test level (unit/integration/e2e)
4. Plan test scenarios including edge cases and error states

### Step 2: Test Implementation
1. Write tests following the testing pyramid principles
2. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
3. Implement proper mocking for external dependencies
4. Include accessibility testing in all component tests
5. Add performance assertions where relevant

### Step 3: Test Validation
1. Run tests and ensure they pass with current implementation
2. Validate test coverage meets requirements
3. Check for flaky tests and improve reliability
4. Ensure tests provide meaningful error messages when failing

### Step 4: Documentation and Reporting
1. Document complex test scenarios and their rationale
2. Report test coverage metrics and gaps
3. Suggest improvements for test reliability and maintainability
4. Provide debugging guidance for failing tests

## Accessibility Testing Integration

### Automated Accessibility Testing
```typescript
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe'
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)

it('should be accessible', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Component />)
  const results = await axe(container)
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations()
})
```

### Manual Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility validation
- Color contrast and visual accessibility checks
- Focus management in modals and dynamic content

## Performance Testing Integration

### Component Performance Testing
```typescript
import { screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'

it('should render large lists efficiently', async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now()
  render(<LargeList items={thousandItems} />)
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('list-container')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
  
  const endTime = performance.now()
  expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(500) // 500ms threshold
})
```

### Bundle Size Impact Testing
- Monitor bundle size impact of new components
- Test code splitting and lazy loading effectiveness
- Validate tree shaking works correctly

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Test Debugging Process
When tests fail:
1. **Analyze Error Messages**: Read test output carefully for specific failure reasons
2. **Check Component State**: Use React Developer Tools to inspect component state
3. **Validate Mocks**: Ensure mocks are properly configured and return expected data
4. **Review Recent Changes**: Compare current code with last known working state
5. **Isolate Issues**: Create minimal reproduction cases for complex failures

### Common Frontend Testing Issues
- **Async Operations**: Proper waiting for async state updates and API calls
- **Event Handling**: Ensuring user events are properly simulated and handled
- **Mock Configuration**: API mocks returning correct data structures
- **State Management**: Component state updates triggering proper re-renders
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation working correctly

## Quality Assurance

- **Test Results**: Summary of passing/failing tests with details
- **Performance Metrics**: Bundle size impact and runtime performance
- **Accessibility Report**: A11y compliance status and recommendations
- **Maintenance Notes**: Any complex test scenarios that need documentation

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Continuous Testing
- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- Run relevant tests after each code change
- Ensure all tests pass before commits
- Maintain test suite health and reliability

### Code Review Support
- Review test coverage for new features
- Suggest testing improvements during code review
- Identify missing test scenarios
- Validate test quality and maintainability
