# Execute Frontend Tasks with Testing Agent

## Usage
```bash
/frontend:execute .planning/frontend/TASKS_SUFFIX.md
```

## Input Processing

### Step 1: Task Document Analysis
Read the frontend task plan document: $ARGUMENTS

**Extract Key Information:**
- Feature name and SUFFIX from filename
- All task phases and individual tasks
- Frontend quality gates and validation commands
- Success criteria and component requirements
- Current branch context (frontend/{SUFFIX})

### Step 2: Frontend Progress Tracking Setup
Create or load progress tracking:
```bash
# Create frontend progress file if not exists
.planning/frontend/PROGRESS_{SUFFIX}.md
```

**Frontend Progress File Structure:**
- Current phase and task with component focus
- Completed tasks with test results and coverage
- Failed tasks with error details and debugging info
- Commit hashes for each completed frontend task
- Test coverage metrics and performance benchmarks

## Frontend Task Execution Strategy

### Phase Execution Loop with Testing Agent
For each phase in the frontend task plan:

**Step 1: Phase Initialization**
- Log phase start in progress file
- Validate frontend prerequisites (node_modules, build tools)
- Set up phase-specific frontend environment

**Step 2: Task Execution with Frontend Testing Agent**
For each task in current phase:

**Task Start:**
- Check if task already completed (resume capability)
- Validate frontend task dependencies are satisfied
- Log task start with timestamp and component context

**Task Implementation with Testing Agent:**
- **Invoke frontend-tester sub agent** for all testing-related tasks
- Execute task following component-first, test-first methodology
- Run validation gates continuously (unit -> integration -> e2e)
- Monitor test results, coverage, and performance metrics

**Frontend-Specific Task Validation:**
- Run unit tests: `npm run test` with coverage reporting
- Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` for user journey validation
- Run linting: `npm run lint` for code quality
- Run build: `npm run build` to ensure production readiness
- Check bundle size and performance metrics

**Task Completion Validation:**
- Validate all frontend tests pass (unit/integration/e2e)
- Check test coverage meets requirements (85%/90%/95% based on complexity)
- Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Ensure ESLint passes with no warnings
- Validate accessibility requirements met

**Frontend Commit Strategy:**
- Create structured commit message with frontend context
- Include component references and test coverage info
- Add Co-authored-by for AI assistance
- Reference original issue and user journey
- Tag with frontend-specific metadata

**Progress Update:**
- Mark task as completed in progress file
- Record commit hash, test coverage, and performance metrics
- Update overall completion percentage
- Log any component-specific notes or decisions

### Frontend Commit Message Strategy

**Conventional Commits for Frontend:**
```
{type}(frontend): {description}

{body}

Components: {list of components affected}
Coverage: {test coverage percentage}
Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>
Co-authored-by: Frontend-Tester Agent
Refs: #{issue_number}
Task: {phase}.{task_number}
Journey: {user_journey_reference}
```

**Frontend Commit Types:**
- `test(frontend)`: Adding or modifying component/e2e tests
- `feat(frontend)`: New frontend feature or component
- `fix(frontend)`: Bug fixes in UI or user interactions
- `style(frontend)`: Styling updates or responsive fixes
- `refactor(frontend)`: Component refactoring with test safety net
- `perf(frontend)`: Performance optimizations
- `a11y(frontend)`: Accessibility improvements

## Frontend Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Validation for Frontend
Before each commit, run comprehensive frontend checks:
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run typecheck

# ESLint with auto-fix
npm run lint

# Unit test execution with coverage
npm run test -- --coverage --run

# Build validation
npm run build

# Bundle size check
npm run build && du -sh dist/

# E2E tests (for integration tasks)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Frontend Regression Testing
After each task completion:
- Run full test suite (unit + integration + e2e)
- Compare test coverage with previous results
- Ensure no UI regression in existing components
- Validate performance metrics haven't degraded
- Check bundle size impact

### Frontend Progress Monitoring
Regular checks during execution:
- Review recent commits for component changes
- Validate task sequence follows frontend workflow
- Check for skipped accessibility or performance tasks
- Monitor test coverage trends and gaps

## Frontend Testing Agent Integration

### When to Invoke frontend-tester Sub Agent
- **All testing tasks**: Unit, integration, and E2E test development
- **Component implementation**: When tests need to be written first
- **Debugging tasks**: When tests fail or components break
- **Performance tasks**: When optimization needs test validation
- **Accessibility tasks**: When a11y features need test coverage

### Frontend Testing Agent Workflow
```bash
# Example invocation during task execution
> Use the frontend-tester sub agent to develop comprehensive unit tests for the CollectionModal component

# Agent handles:
# 1. Analyzes component requirements
# 2. Writes tests following React Testing Library best practices  
# 3. Ensures proper mocking of API calls
# 4. Validates accessibility features
# 5. Runs tests and reports coverage
```
