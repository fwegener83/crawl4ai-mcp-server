# Execute Frontend Plan with Backend Integration

## Usage
```bash
/frontend:execute .planning/frontend/PLAN_SUFFIX.md
```

## Input Processing

### Step 1: Plan Document Analysis
Read the comprehensive frontend plan document: $ARGUMENTS

**Extract Key Information:**
- Feature name and SUFFIX from filename
- Complexity assessment and selected test strategy
- User journey technical analysis with backend integration
- Component architecture and API integration requirements
- Task breakdown with backend integration phases
- Success criteria including full-stack validation

### Step 2: Frontend Progress Tracking Setup
Create or load progress tracking:
```bash
# Create frontend progress file if not exists
.planning/frontend/PROGRESS_{SUFFIX}.md
```

**Enhanced Progress File Structure:**
- Current phase and task with component and backend API focus
- Completed tasks with test results, coverage, and backend integration status
- Failed tasks with error details and debugging info for both frontend and backend
- Commit hashes for each completed frontend task
- Test coverage metrics and performance benchmarks
- Backend API integration validation status

## Full-Stack Task Execution Strategy

### Phase Execution Loop with Backend-Aware Testing
For each phase in the frontend plan:

**Step 1: Phase Initialization**
- Log phase start in progress file with backend integration context
- Validate full-stack prerequisites (backend running, APIs accessible)
- Set up phase-specific environment (frontend + backend)
- Verify backend API availability and authentication

**Step 2: Task Execution with Backend Integration**
For each task in current phase:

**Task Start:**
- Check if task already completed (resume capability)
- Validate both frontend and backend dependencies are satisfied
- Log task start with timestamp and full-stack context

**Task Implementation with Frontend Testing Agent:**
- **Invoke frontend-tester sub agent** for all testing-related tasks with backend context
- Execute task following component-first, backend-integrated, test-first methodology
- Run validation gates continuously (unit -> integration -> backend -> e2e)
- Monitor test results, coverage, performance metrics, and API integration status

**Full-Stack Task Validation:**
- Run unit tests: `npm run test` with API mocking and coverage reporting
- Run integration tests: API integration with real backend endpoints
- Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` for complete user journey validation
- Run linting: `npm run lint` for code quality
- Run build: `npm run build` to ensure production readiness
- Check bundle size and performance metrics
- **Validate backend API integration**: Test real API calls and data contracts

**Task Completion Validation:**
- Validate all frontend tests pass (unit/integration/e2e)
- **Verify backend API integration works correctly**
- Check test coverage meets requirements (85%/90%/95% based on complexity)
- Verify TypeScript compilation with no errors
- Ensure ESLint passes with no warnings
- Validate accessibility requirements met
- **Confirm data contracts between frontend and backend**

**Full-Stack Commit Strategy:**
- Create structured commit message with frontend and backend context
- Include component references, API endpoints, and test coverage info
- Add Co-authored-by for AI assistance
- Reference original issue and user journey
- Tag with frontend-specific and backend integration metadata

**Progress Update:**
- Mark task as completed in progress file
- Record commit hash, test coverage, performance metrics, and API integration status
- Update overall completion percentage
- Log any component-specific notes, backend integration decisions, or API changes

### Full-Stack Commit Message Strategy

```

**Full-Stack Commit Types:**

## Full-Stack Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Validation for Full-Stack Frontend
Before each commit, run comprehensive frontend and backend integration checks:
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
cd frontend && npm run typecheck

# ESLint with auto-fix
cd frontend && npm run lint

# Unit test execution with coverage (including API mocks)
cd frontend && npm run test -- --coverage --run

# Backend integration validation
cd frontend && npm run test:integration

# Build validation
cd frontend && npm run build

# Bundle size check
cd frontend && npm run build && du -sh dist/

# E2E tests with full backend integration
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e

# Backend API health check
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Backend not available"
```

### Full-Stack Regression Testing
After each task completion:
- Run full test suite (unit + integration + backend + e2e)
- Compare test coverage with previous results
- Ensure no UI regression in existing components
- **Validate backend API contracts haven't broken**
- Validate performance metrics haven't degraded
- Check bundle size impact
- **Test full user journeys with real backend data**

### Full-Stack Progress Monitoring
Regular checks during execution:
- Review recent commits for component and API integration changes
- Validate task sequence follows full-stack workflow
- Check for skipped accessibility, performance, or backend integration tasks
- Monitor test coverage trends and gaps
- **Track backend API integration completeness**

## Backend-Aware Testing Agent Integration

### When to Invoke frontend-tester Sub Agent
- **All testing tasks**: Unit, integration, backend, and E2E test development
- **Component implementation**: When tests need to be written first with backend integration
- **API integration tasks**: When frontend components need backend API connections
- **Debugging tasks**: When tests fail, components break, or API integration fails
- **Performance tasks**: When optimization needs test validation including API performance
- **Accessibility tasks**: When a11y features need test coverage
- **Backend integration validation**: When API contracts need frontend testing

### Backend-Aware Testing Agent Workflow
```bash
# Example invocation during task execution with backend context
> Use the frontend-tester sub agent to develop comprehensive tests for the CollectionModal component including backend API integration for the /api/collections endpoint

# Agent handles:
# 1. Analyzes component requirements including backend API dependencies
# 2. Writes tests following React Testing Library best practices with API mocking
# 3. Creates integration tests for real backend API calls
# 4. Ensures proper error handling for API failures
# 5. Validates data contracts between frontend and backend
# 6. Runs tests and reports coverage including API integration coverage
```
