# Create GitHub Issue from Project File

Analyze the given project file and create a comprehensive GitHub issue with exploration, planning, and implementation details.

## Usage
Use this command with a project file as argument:
```
/project:create-issue INITIAL.md
```

## Process

### 1. Exploration Phase
Read and analyze the project file: $ARGUMENTS

Explore the following aspects:
- **Project Goals**: What is the main objective and scope?
- **Technical Requirements**: What technologies, frameworks, and dependencies are needed?
- **Feature Breakdown**: What are the core features and functionality?
- **Constraints and Considerations**: What limitations or special requirements exist?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know when this is complete?

### 2. Planning Phase
Based on the exploration, create a detailed implementation plan:
- **Project Structure**: Recommended folder and file organization
- **Implementation Steps**: Break down into logical, sequential tasks
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be set up first (environment, tools, configs)
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify each component works
- **Documentation**: What docs need to be created or updated

### 3. Issue Creation
Create a GitHub issue that includes:
- Clear title summarizing the project goal
- Comprehensive description with exploration findings
- Detailed task breakdown with checkboxes
- Implementation plan with phases
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications
- Labels and milestones (if applicable)

## Instructions
1. **DO NOT** start coding or implementing anything yet
2. **READ** the specified file thoroughly first
3. **ANALYZE** all requirements and technical details
4. **PLAN** the complete implementation approach
5. **CREATE** a well-structured GitHub issue with all findings
6. **INCLUDE** all exploration and planning details in the issue body

The goal is to transform the project file into a actionable GitHub issue that serves as a complete blueprint for implementation.
